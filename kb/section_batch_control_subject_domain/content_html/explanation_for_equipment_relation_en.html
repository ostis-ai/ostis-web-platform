<p>
The equipment in, for example, a <sc_element sys_idtf  = "process_cell">process cell</sc_element> (i.e., <sc_element sys_idtf  = "unit">units</sc_element>, <sc_element sys_idtf  = "equipment_module">equipment modules</sc_element>, <sc_element sys_idtf  = "control_module">control modules</sc_element>) is normally related to each other by pipes or other connections. The connections may be modeled as equipment relations, optionally with a direction (e.g., a flow direction). The relations (e.g., pipes) are part of the higher-level <sc_element sys_idtf  = "equipment_entity">equipment entity</sc_element>. Relations other than connections may be possible.
