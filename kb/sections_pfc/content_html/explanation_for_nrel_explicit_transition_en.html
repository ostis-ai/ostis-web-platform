<p> Explicit transition* is a binary relation, the second component of the linkage of which is <i><sc_element sys_idtf  = "procedural_element">a procedural element</sc_element></i>, the execution of which will begin after the execution of <i><sc_element sys_idtf  = "procedural_element">the procedural element</sc_element></i>, which is the first component of the linkage and a certain condition is checked. </p>
